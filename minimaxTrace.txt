 Step-by-step Trace of miniMax:
AI's Turn (Maximizing)
AI tries placing 'O' in the empty spots (indexes 5, 6, 7).
First Move: Place 'O' at index 5
Board becomes: ['X', 'O', 'X', 'O', 'X', 'O', '-', '-', 'O']
Evaluate the board: no winner yet.
Call minimax recursively to simulate the Human's response.
Human's Turn (Minimizing, index 5 filled)
Human has options to place 'X' at index 6 or 7.
Tries index 6: Board becomes: ['X', 'O', 'X', 'O', 'X', 'O', 'X', '-', 'O']
Evaluate: no winner.
AI's turn again, places 'O' at index 7 (only move left).
Board: ['X', 'O', 'X', 'O', 'X', 'O', 'X', 'O', 'O']
Evaluate: AI wins with a vertical line through the third column.
Minimax returns a score of +10 for AI (win).
Backtrack and Try Other Moves
Undo previous moves, try next human option (index 7 without filling index 6):
['X', 'O', 'X', 'O', 'X', 'O', '-', 'X', 'O']
Evaluate: no winner.
AI's turn, only one spot left at index 6.
['X', 'O', 'X', 'O', 'X', 'O', 'O', 'X', 'O']
Evaluate: no win, the game ends in a draw (score of 0).
Evaluate Best Option
From the AI's perspective, placing 'O' at index 5 resulted in scenarios:
Win (score +10) when Human chooses poorly.
Draw (score 0) for the best Human response.
AI chooses the move with the highest score from these simulations, which is index 5 leading to a potential win.
